    <p>Return Variables:|Description
|---|---|
|devt:|Device time (epoch time). This is always the local time.
|nbrd:|Number of 8-station boards (including main controller).
|en:|Operation enable bit.
|rd:|Rain delay bit (1: rain delay is currently in effect; 0: no rain delay).
|rs:|Rain sensor status bit (1: rain is detected from rain sensor; 0: no rain detected).
|loc: |Location string.
|wtkey:| Wunderground API key.
|sunrise:| Today’s sunrise time (minutes from midnight).
|sunset:| Today’s sunset time (minutes from midnight).
|sbits:|Station status bits. Each byte in this array corresponds to an 8-station board and represents the bit field (LSB). For example, 1 means the 1st station on the board is open, 192 means the 7th and 8th stations are open.
|ps:|Program status data: each element is a 3-field array that stores the [pid,rem,start] of a station, where pid is the program index (0 means non), rem is the remaining water time (in seconds), start is the start time. If a station is not running (sbit is 0) but has a non-zero pid, that means the station is in the queue waiting to run.
|lrun:|Last run record, which stores the [station index, program index, duration, end time] of the last run station.</p>
